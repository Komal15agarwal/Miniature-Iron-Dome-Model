### Introduction to Radar & Detection Technology
Radar and detection technology form the backbone of modern air defense systems, enabling the early identification, tracking, and interception of incoming threats such as rockets, missiles, and drones. These systems use radio waves to detect objects at long distances, analyze their trajectory, and classify potential threats. The Iron Dome, for example, relies on advanced Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar to provide real-time tracking and trajectory prediction. By integrating artificial intelligence (AI) and secure data links, modern radar systems can distinguish between genuine threats and harmless objects, ensuring efficient use of interceptor missiles. This technology plays a critical role in national security, military operations, and civilian protection, making it a key component of multi-layered air defense networks.

### Introduction

The Miniature Iron Dome (Mini-Iron Dome) is an advanced, compact missile defense system designed to protect smaller-scale areas, military units, and mobile assets from aerial threats such as drones, mortars, and small rockets. Developed by Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, it builds upon the success of the full-scale Iron Dome but is optimized for portability and flexibility in the battlefield.

Some of the Dome technology that were used in the past years are discussed below:-<br>
[1] Western societies' reliance on advanced technology has made them vulnerable, as vital infrastructure often prioritizes productivity over safety. With the rise of automation and dependence on the internet, traditional security protocols are proving to be inadequate. This paper emphasizes the growing necessity for automated defense mechanisms to combat cyberattacks targeting critical systems.<br>
[2] The rapid advancement of technology has led to a demand for agile development, creating a challenge in balancing speed with quality in system design. This paper introduces a specific agile Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) framework that utilizes Object-Process Methodology (OPM) to achieve a balance between agility and robustness. The framework extends traditional system modeling to support evolution, feedback, and configuration management. Its effectiveness is demonstrated through a hypothetical ballistic missile defense system inspired by Israel's Iron Dome.<br>
[3] While the Iron Dome missile defense system has shown a success rate of approximately 90% in intercepting rockets during recent conflicts, there is room for improvement in countering short-range missiles and mortars along the Gaza coast. To address this issue, Israel is developing a more advanced system known as Iron Beam, which will utilize laser technology to enhance its capabilities in targeting such attacks.<br> 
As per the above three references [1],[2] and [3] we implemented the prototype of iron dome developed using Arduino Uno to simulate automated threat detection and experimental purposes.<br>
[4] The article delves into the evolving strategies of Palestinian militant forces in response to Israel's security fences, culminating in Hamas's October 7 assault. The author introduces the Security Barrier-Adaptation Model (SBAM) to analyze the cycle of barrier innovation, counter-adaptive measures, and systemic readjustment. The research highlights how tunnels, land routes, and maritime avenues have been utilized to bypass Israeli defenses, exposing the vulnerabilities of fixed security measures. It emphasizes the continual adaptation of adversarial strategies in asymmetric warfare.<br>
[5] The radar-guided defense system, controlled by Arduino, offers a cost-effective solution by integrating radar sensors with an Arduino board to detect and respond to imminent threats. Operating independently, it can launch missiles with enhanced accuracy and responsiveness, making it suitable for small-scale applications. This system demonstrates the practical application of microcontroller and sensor technology in defense systems, providing an affordable and adaptable solution for resource-constrained environments.<br>
As per the reference no [4] and [5] we have used arduino as the control system which controls the movements of the IR proximity sensor which tracks the object by providing accurate alignment of the middle sensor towards the object.<br>
[6] This paper explores the interplay between Israel's military actions and its legal and ethical constraints, particularly in its conflict with terrorist organizations. It examines the role of the Iron Dome in protecting civilians and considers the impact of such a defense system on the moral legitimacy of military operations. The discussion is framed within the context of just war theory (jus ad bellum), assessing the moral justifiability of warfare.<br>
[7] This paper examines the application of sophisticated navigation systems in war robots, from wired control to wireless communication. It presents a gesture-controlled system with Arduino Nano v3 and ATMEGA-based microcontrollers and incorporates sensors such as an accelerometer and MPU6050 gyroscope for motion detection. Experimental outcomes indicate that the gesture control system is efficient, simple to operate, and compatible with military uses. The research concludes that this technology promotes the navigation of robots and presents a secure and efficient control strategy for combat robots.<br>
As per the references [6] and [7] we want to add up this points to our reference scope as it would be great aspect to see the world during wars.<br>
[8] This paper examines the deficiency of global legal frameworks treating smart defense systems such as Israel's Iron Dome. It proposes that international humanitarian law (IHL) can define IDSs as civil defense to motivate their adoption to defend civilians. Nonetheless, whereas these systems are aligned with humanitarian objectives, they might induce more rocket attacks and test conventional IHL norms, which target the protection of the opponent over one's side. Notwithstanding this, the article posits that the failure to assist IDPs violates IHL's fundamental purpose and could lead to more casualties.<br>
[9] The fast growth of IoT networks has raised security threats, which are exposed to massive malware attacks that can propagate through connected devices. Conventional detection and quarantining mechanisms are not adequate to prevent malware propagation. This paper presents "IRON-DOME," an integrated defense system comprising image-based malware detection, hardware performance analysis, and network packet monitoring. The solution that is proposed takes 93% detection in 19 ns while being 30% more resource-intensive and 40% more power-intensive compared to other methods.<br>
[10] The work in this paper formulates a model for analyzing the efficacy of Israel's Iron Dome to intercept short-range ballistic missiles. It investigates issues such as failure to intercept, error in classifying missiles, and the effects of large rocket salvos. The study finds that although high interception rates enhance defense, the system becomes more susceptible when overloaded. Utilizing data from Operation Pillar of Defense (2012), the model predicts Iron Dome prevented 1,778 fatalities and $80 million in damages, rendering preemptive attacks less essential to Israel.
[11] Iron Dome was developed in response to Hezbollah’s rocket attacks in 2006 and has been praised for its high interception rate, with claims of 90% effectiveness in conflicts since 2011. However, its true efficacy remains uncertain due to classified data and inconclusive independent analyses. The paper argues that Iron Dome’s success may decline in future conflicts as adversaries increase rocket volume and accuracy. Unless further breakthroughs in missile defense occur, Israel may experience military and political difficulties if expectations of Iron Dome are unrealistically high.<br>
As per the above references [8],[9],[10] and [11] the papers explore Iron Dome from legal, technical, and strategic perspectives. One advocates its recognition under IHL as civil defense, while another uses its name metaphorically for an IoT malware defense system. Technical analyses highlight its high interception rate but warn of overload vulnerabilities and unrealistic expectations in future conflicts.<br>
[12] This dissertation analyzes the U.S. development of a continental air defense system during the Cold War to neutralize Soviet air threats. Applying the framework of vertical geopolitics, it analyzes how the military exercises of 1960-1962 put this defense strategy to the test. The study points out how the U.S. and Canada, out of a feeling of vulnerability, developed an integrated radar, human, and weapons-based air defense network. The study concludes that America's Cold War defense policy was not only land-based fortifications but also securing and controlling airspace.<br>
[13] This essay explores the case of Israel's Iron Dome to analyze how technology influences state power and security relations. Applying object-oriented ontology and actor-network theory concepts, it examines Iron Dome as an advanced system possessing abilities beyond its original purpose. The research discovers that despite improving security, Iron Dome's influence is uncertain, at times supporting or deconstructing state authority. It emphasizes the importance of taking into account the political and emotional aspects of security technology beyond their technical merits.<br>
[14] This research assesses the efficacy of counter-terrorism through the lens of Israel's Iron Dome's effect on civilian life. Results indicate that Iron Dome mitigated the adverse impact of rocket attacks on housing prices and reduced in-house shelter dependency. Surveys and anti-anxiety drug purchases indicate that the system also enhanced psychological health by reducing daily disruption and distress. Overall, Iron Dome lessened the economic and psychological costs of life threatened by rocket attacks.<br>
As per the references [12],[13] and [14] the tracking intensity of the sensor is high up to 80 cm which for the initial phase of implementation shows a great result of analysis of the object and its tracking.<br>
[15] The Israeli Air Force was able to destroy most Iranian-provided rocket launchers during the 2006 conflict, but Hezbollah's short-range Katyusha rockets continued to do great damage. There were more than 4,228 rocket strikes, with thousands of homes destroyed and an estimated 250,000 civilians temporarily displaced. Though Israel's missile defense systems did cut down casualties, the risk of massive, simultaneous missile attacks continues to be a worry. In response, Israel has conducted an advanced missile shield test, Operation Tiramisu, to prepare for possible future large-scale attacks.<br>
[16]Israel's rocket and missile market has seen significant advancements, primarily driven by ongoing regional conflicts, such as the Israel-Hamas war. During this conflict, the country successfully intercepted over 300 Iranian ballistic missiles and drones through its missile defense systems.<br>
