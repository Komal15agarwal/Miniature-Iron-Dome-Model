## Introduction
### Introduction to Miniature Iron Dome
The Miniature Iron Dome Model is a scaled-down prototype designed to replicate the core functions of the real-world Iron Dome missile defense system. This model focuses on detecting, track incoming threats using a combination of sensors, microcontrollers, actuators, and automated launching mechanisms. By integrating Proximity sensors, the prototype can identify approaching objects, analyze potential threats, and deploy countermeasures in real-time. The system utilizes Arduino Shield as the central processing unit, while stepper motors control movement for accurate targeting. This project serves as an educational and research tool, helping students and enthusiasts understand missile defense, automation, and embedded systems through hands-on learning. The integration of wireless communication, artificial intelligence, and autonomous decision-making makes it a versatile platform for future enhancements in defense simulations and robotics applications. Through this model shown in Figure 1.1, we aim to provide a practical understanding of automated tracking, demonstrating how advanced defense technologies can be miniaturized for research and learning purposes.<br>

#### Growth of use Iron Dome
As per the graph shown in Figure 1.2 the Miniature Iron Dome is witnessing rapid growth due to the rising demand for mobile air defense against evolving threats like drones, rockets, and artillery. Unlike the traditional Iron Dome, which protects fixed locations, the miniature version is designed for armored vehicles, naval ships, and small bases, offering on-the-move protection. The increasing use of drones, loitering munitions, and suicide drones by both state and non-state actors has further accelerated its adoption. Countries like the U.S., India, South Korea, and several European nations have shown interest in deploying it for military bases, convoys, and naval defense. Advancements in AI-based threat detection and laser-based interceptors are expected to enhance its efficiency, making it a cost-effective, scalable solution for modern warfare. As urban conflicts and asymmetric threats continue to rise, the demand for compact, rapidly deployable missile defense systems like the Miniature Iron Dome is projected to grow significantly.
